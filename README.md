📊 Telecom Churn Analysis – EDA Project
This project explores and analyzes customer churn data from a telecom company. The primary goal is to identify key factors contributing to churn and visualize patterns that can help drive actionable business insights.

🔍 Project Objectives
Understand the distribution and relationships of customer features

Identify which features are highly associated with churn

Visualize trends using Python libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas

Derive actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following features:

State, Area code, Phone number

Account length, International plan, Voice mail plan

Call minutes (day, evening, night, international)

Charges (corresponding to above calls)

Customer service calls

Churn (Target variable)

The dataset is clean and structured, ideal for exploratory data analysis.

📌 Key Analysis Highlights
🔹 Distribution of churn vs. non-churn customers

🔹 Impact of service plans (voice mail, international)

🔹 Total charge and call duration patterns

🔹 State-wise churn rates

🔹 Correlation heatmaps for numeric variables

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📈 Visualizations
Pie charts and count plots to show churn distributions

Box plots for comparing charges and durations

Heatmap for identifying highly correlated numeric features

Grouped bar plots for categorical breakdowns

💡 Insights Derived
Customers with international plans churn more often.

High number of customer service calls is linked to churn.

Voice mail plan users show slightly better retention.

Total charges and usage minutes show meaningful churn patterns.

🚀 Getting Started
